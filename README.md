# citiation-needed

This is a tiny Chrome extension that highlights anonymous sources in news articles, such as [this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/isis-strategies-include-lines-of-succession-and-deadly-ring-tones.html).

If you'd like to contribute, improving the [main regex](https://github.com/gka/citiation-needed/blob/master/extension/citation-needed.js#L4) would a good place to start.
